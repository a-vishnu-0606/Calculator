# Calculator

A calculator webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a user interface with buttons for numerical input and operations. JavaScript handles user interactions, performs calculations based on input, and displays results dynamically. The layout is designed for responsiveness, allowing the calculator to function seamlessly on various devices. The final webpage can be hosted online using platforms like GitHub Pages or similar hosting services.
